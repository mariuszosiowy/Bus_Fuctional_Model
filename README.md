# Bus_Fuctional_Model
The Aldec AXI BFM (Bus functional models) are a detailed software models of AXI Master and AXI Slave with AXI3/AXI4/AXI4Lite interfaces support used to simulate customer-designed AXI-based IP cores. Our BFM's are Verilog modules with a SystemVerilog interface feature. It is dedicated to multi IPCores vendor in simulations flow with Riviera-Pro. Aldec BFM's can be used in main vendors tools (AMD/Vivado, Intel/Quartus, Microchip/Libero ) as AXI MASTER and Slave IPCores for simulate generated designs.
Apart from the main System Verilog interface  Aldec BFMs can also be used to work with UVM, Cocotb, QEMU, Systemc testbenches. 
The folder include examples how use BFM to support AMBA AXI traffic (generator / target).
